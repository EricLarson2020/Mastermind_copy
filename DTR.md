# Project: Mastermind

Group Member Names: Logan Anderson, Wyatt Wicks

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
  - Our expectations are to create a well running program that fully meets the requirements of the assignment. Our goal is to finish with enough time to try to complete some of the extensions. Both of us are shooting to get at least a 3.

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
  - Both team members have extremely flexible and open schedules. We'll collaborate primarily through working together on zoom and a shared GitHub repository.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
  - Strong communication skills in a professional setting in order to optimize team cohesion.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):
  - Both partners are free before and after class every day, but not during lunches. Try to be done with work before 8-9. Try to put in at least an hour every day.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):
  - We already exchanged phone numbers in order to make sure we have a better method of reaching each other. We will communicate once a day to set up the zoom meetings for the time we want to work. During the zoom meetings we will be able to have more thorough communication. Slack messages during class if something strikes one of us as useful.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
  - Develop the necessary skills to work with a partner and eventually a group in a coding workplace, especially in a remote environment.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
  - We will try to make as fair of an even split as possible. The majority of the work will be done collaboratively so there should be a fair balance of work.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
  - The first thing we did when getting partnered together was establish a GitHub repo and describe how we will use branches to work on it. If one person makes a pull request from a branch, the other will always merge it, that way both partners have a good sense of what is going on in the project.

Pomodoro Break Schedule:
  - When working together we will try to take our Pom breaks during points that feel like natural breaks or stopping points in the work.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
  - Neither partner is bothered by feedback. If we don't understand something we will ask for an explanation.

Additional Remote Considerations:
  - Zoom calls and screen sharing should help alleviate most of the remote issues.

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):
  - We will be using a Trello board as well as a shared repo.
